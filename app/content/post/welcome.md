# Welcome

Welcome to my blog! Here, I blabber on about all kinds of software engineering/development things (mostly C# and .NET). I offer up my opinionated takes on various topics. Most of my posts will focus on code quality and testing. Providing tips and tricks to write (in my opinion) cleaner and (hopefully) safer code. Feel free to take everything I say with a grain of salt, it's only my personal opinion.
