Hi! My name is _Wesley Baartman_, also known online as _CptWesley_. I'm a software engineer who graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. I have a passion for anything related to programming language design, software quality and transfering my knowledge to others. I'm a strong believer of the philosophy which can be captured by a famous quote contributed to physicist Richard Feynman: _What I cannot create, I do not understand_. As a consequence, one of my favourite pasttime activities is reinventing the wheel by implementing libraries that already exist in order to better understand how they actually work.
