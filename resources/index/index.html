<h1>Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi, my name is Wesley Baartman. I'm a Computer Science student at the Delft University of Technology in my early twenties.
    Like many of my peers, my hobbies include listening to music, playing video games and programming. My favourite band is <i>Sabaton</i>.
    My favourite game is <i>Europa Univeralis IV</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Although my favourite programming language is <i>C#</i>, I like experimenting with different languages. I generally prefer to do backend programming.
    I have a huge fascination for everything that has to do with compiling, interpreting, transpiling and interoptability.
